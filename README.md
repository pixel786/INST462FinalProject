# INST462FinalProject

Steps we used to clean the data: 
1. Data Cleaning - 2011.R selected the variables, the particular region we wanted, and also recoded the numeric values to descriptions from the codebook. This was repeated for all the files for each year. 

2. Then, we combined all datasets for each year using the Master_Dataset.R file. 

3. Then, we selected 200 rows for each region in the DMV for all years (2011-2015) with a final total of 3000 rows. The complete_brfss.csv contains the dataset used for the visualizations and Dataset-3000Final.R contains the code to complete this step.
